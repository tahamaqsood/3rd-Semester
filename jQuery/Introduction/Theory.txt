=> document.getElementById("IdName");                 $("#IdName");

=> document.getElementByClassName("ClassName");       $(".ClassName");

=> document.getElementByTagName("TagName");           $("TagName");


* jQuery is a lightweight, "WRITE LESS, DO MORE", JS library.

* The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use Javascript on your web page.

* jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JS code to accomplish
  and wraps them into built-in methods that you can call with a single line of code.

* jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JS, like Ajax call and
  other DOM manipulation.

* Note: When a web page or HTML page loads in the browsers, browser creates DOM
  (document object model) for the page.

* DOCUMENT - HTML page
* OBJECT   - Tags or elements and attributes in HTML page.
* MODEL    - In DOM, Tree structure of HTML elements.

* jQuery offers several utility functions.

* Plugin framework third party and official plugins.

* Any feature can be included through plugin, like jQuery Data Table.

* Resolves cross browser issues.

* jQuery implemented compatibility code.

* Exclusive community where developers improve functionalities.

* Offers several plugins which accelerate web development process strong community.

* Supports Ajax by creating Ajax templates.
