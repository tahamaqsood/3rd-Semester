==========================
CONTAINERS IN BOOTSTRAP 5:
==========================

* Bootsttrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents.

* Containers are used to gather and group the content inside of them, and there are
  two container classes available:
  1) container
  2) container-fuild 

* The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container.

* The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire
  width of the viewport.

* By default, containers have left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding.

* Therefore, we often use spacing utilities , such as extra padding and margins to 
  make them look even better.

* For example, .pt-5 means "Add a large top padding".

* Other utilities, such as borders and colors, are also often used together with containers.

* Note: You can also use the .container-sm|md|lg|xl classes to determine when the container
        should be responsive.
