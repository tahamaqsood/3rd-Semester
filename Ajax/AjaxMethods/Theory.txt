
=============
AJAX METHODS:
=============

* The jQuery ajax() method provides core functionality of Ajax in jQuery.

* It sends asynchronous HTTP requests to the server.

* The best thing about $.ajax() method is that we can use this method in place of
  $.get() , $.post() and $.load() methods.

* Syntax: $.ajax({options});

* Note: Options can be specified with the help of "Name Value Pair".


* Most common options are;

  => type: It is used to specify the type of request.

  => url: It is used to specify the URL to send the request to.

  => data: It is used to specify the data to be sent to the server within key value pair.

  => dataType: No need to define this option. It will auto detect the type of data which can either be in xml or json or html.

  => contentType: Use this option if your form contains file controller. File controller can be use for image, docx file, excel sheet, Word file etc.

  => processData: Use this option only if you are not using "data" option which can be defined in Key Value Pair.

  => success: It is a function to be run when the request succeeds.

  => error: It is a function to be run if the requests fails.

  => complete: It is a function to be run when the request is being finished.

  => async: It's default value is true. It indicates whether the request should be handled asynchronous or not.


* Note: If you are not passing value to data option within key value pair, then must use processData option and
        give the value 'false' (without quotation).
        Give contentType option the value "multipart/formdata" or "false". (false without quotation).
        if "multipart/formdata" is unable to do work, then simply give false value to contentType option.
