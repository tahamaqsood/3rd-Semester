* Ajax enables an application to send and recieve only the data that is required as a result 
  that is reduced traffic between the client and the server and better performance.

* The keystone of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest object.

* All the modern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object.

* The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange the data with a server behind the scenes.

* XMLHttpRequest is used by JavaScript to communicate with the server side components.

* Transfers data in the form of plain text, XML, or JSON format.

* Retrieves data from the server asynchronously.

* Allows web pages to request data from a server using client-side code.

* Provides properties and methods to access the server response.

* AJAX improves performance of the page by enabling users to carry on with their tasks
  after sending a request to the server.
